  <name>Prevent users to overwrite on their record while trying to add a new participant/contrib</name>
  <description>Civi by default pre-select your own contact details when you register to an event (or other public visible forms) if you are logged in. It is generally a good thing, but might lead to errors, for instance when a team member will overwrite their own contact record, or if one forward an invitation they received to someone else.
This extension put the first and last name fields read only, to prevent these mistake

  <comment>Based on an idea and initial code from Stoob. This isn't bulletproof, as the user needs javascript enabled, but avoid common errors.</comment>
